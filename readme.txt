==================

1.  Introduction

This is a logfile parser/stats generator for Quake 3 Arena log files.  It takes standard Quake 3 Arena log files and generates cutdown versions which it stores and adds to with any new log files.  These cutdown log files are then used to generate stats pages in HTML format.

It is written entirely in Java, and should work with Java 2 (1.4) and higher.  A full Runtime Environment is needed to use this program, but it should work under any OS there is a Runtime Environment for.

2.  New Features

Q3Log v1.2 is now fully template driven.  The template files are detailed below.  This should make customising the output generated by Q3Log much simpler.

3.  Installation

Simply unzip the install file anywhere on your machine.  You should have the following directories:

  bin - contains the java files and the main config file
  input - should be used to hold the cutdown log files
  logs - should be used to hold the standard Quake 3 Arena log files
  output - should be used to store the output stats files
  static - holds the static HTML files that wrap around the stats files
  templates - Holds the template files used for the output

You should now setup the config file (Q3Log.conf usually) to contain the values you require (the file is commented)

4.  Usage

Drop your log files (games.log usually) into the logs directory and then run the program.  do:
  java Q3Log help
for help on the parameters you can pass in and what they mean.

Once run, you should have all the HTML files you need containing the stats.

If you want to customise the output you will need to edit the following files (in the templates folder):
  table_main.htm_ - The main page containing summary stats info
  table_row.htm_ - Each row of the summary stats table
  table_total.htm_ - The totals row of the summary stats table
  indiv_main.htm_ - The main page holding detailed information for each user
  indiv_oponents.htm_ - Each row of the individual details page table
  indiv_oponents_total.htm_ - The totals row of the individual details page table
  indiv_weapons.htm_ - The details of weapons used for each individual user
  indiv_weapons_total.htm_ - The totals for the weapons used for each individual user

5.  Future Enhancements

No future enhancement is planned.  If you have any suggestions or requests e-mail me at q3logger@wilf.co.uk.

I dont know of any bugs with the program as it stands.  If you find any please e-mail me a full bug report to q3logger@wilf.co.uk

6.  Distribution

Generally this program is under GPL licence terms.  Rough details are:

You are free to distribute this program as you wish, provided you dont charge for it and you include this readme file with the program unchanged (unless you make changes to the program that need to be reflected in here).  If you want to put this program on a magazine CD/DVD/Whatever then please contact me at givememoney@wilf.co.uk and we can talk about it.

If you want to modify this program, feel free!  I have included the .java file to make it easier.  The comments are a bit sketchy, and the coding is very poor (I havent got time to look over it and make it anywhere near good), so good luck.  You can distribute your changed program as long as you dont charge for it, and provided that you include my name and e-mail address and state I wrote the original that you improved on.  Also, you should only distribute any versions of this program if they have a readme or similar file that states that it shouldnt be distributed for money.

7.  Feedback

If you have any feedback or questions (and have read this file and the help generated by the program first) then please contact me at q3logger@wilf.co.uk
